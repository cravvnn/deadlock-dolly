# Portable runtime notices

The Windows release script includes Python's installed `LICENSE.txt` and
PyInstaller's installed `COPYING.txt` alongside these notices. PyInstaller's
bootloader distribution exception is in its COPYING file. The source repository
does not contain the Python interpreter or the PyInstaller bootloader itself.

The Tcl/Tk notices here were obtained from the upstream 8.6 branch release:

- [Tcl notice](https://github.com/tcltk/tcl/blob/core-8-6-16/license.terms)
- [Tk notice](https://github.com/tcltk/tk/blob/core-8-6-16/license.terms)

The actual Tcl/Tk runtime version is read during the Windows bundle self-test.
These notices do not assert that a particular Python installation bundles
exactly 8.6.16. The cvar unlocker retains its separate MIT license and pinned
provenance under `third_party/cvar_unlocker/`.

The native in-game panel contains Dear ImGui, copyright Omar Cornut and
contributors, under its MIT license. The exact vendored revision and file
hashes are recorded in `native/vendor/imgui/UPSTREAM.json`. Its license and
MinHook's license are copied into the portable notices folder by the Windows
build script. The project uses the official Win32 and DirectX 11 backends.
