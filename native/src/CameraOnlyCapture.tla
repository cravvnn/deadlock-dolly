---- MODULE CameraOnlyCapture ----
EXTENDS Naturals
\* Camera-only branch of video::capture / finish_camera_only.
\* Existing caller: overlay clean_frame, serialized Present/Resize boundary.
\* One admitted callback can overlap worker stop/cancel. Closing ready precedes
\* waiting for that callback; no file publication on the render thread.
\* Two frames represent a bounded take. Valid abstracts actual native clock,
\* pose, fresh-view, dimensions and contiguous-cadence checks, tested in C++.
\* This is raw camera-trace publication, NOT final .crav success. Replay SHA
\* pin/recheck and final no-overwrite publication remain Python obligations.
\* Cancel may arrive until done. finish_camera_only takes one cancel decision
\* (decide_cancel) after quiesce_producers; publication and the terminal state
\* both follow it, so a cancel after the decision completes consistently
\* (OutcomeAgrees). Python's own cancel check still refuses the .crav.
\* The ready/producer_active store/load handshake is seq_cst on both sides; its
\* store-buffer race is modeled in VideoCompleteness.tla, so Enter stays atomic.
\* Excludes GPU behavior, Windows filesystem semantics and whole-program proof.
