EXTENDS Naturals
\* encode/encode_ffmpeg via worker start; capture via Present; stop via media.
\* Bounded projection: one admitted GPU frame, returning drain, cancellation,
\* fixed-step queue timeout, late GPU loss and final publication. No game clock,
\* pixel correctness or encoder reliability. Existing MediaFinalize/MediaAdmission
\* cover transport ownership.
\*
\* Stop barrier (quiesce_producers + capture's ProducerScope): ClearReady is
\* ready.store(false); ObserveIdle is the producer_active wait followed by the
\* gpu_pending exchange and CPU drain (a frame published before it is counted:
\* drained or added to dropped). Enter is producer_active.fetch_add, CheckReady
\* is capture's ready load and Publish is produced/gpu_pending publication.
\* `buffered` is the encoder's store-buffer entry for ready=false: with
\* release/acquire ordering x86-TSO may let the encoder's producer_active load
\* complete before that store is visible (FlushReady). The seq_cst store (xchg)
\* is visible before the next load. The producer's lock-prefixed RMW is never
\* reordered on x86, so only the encoder store is buffered. This models x86-TSO
\* store->load reordering only; it is not a proof of the C++ memory model.
\* One producer cycles; the duplicate exception-path barrier is idempotent.
\*
\* Finalization: Decide is the single `cancelled` snapshot taken after the
\* barrier (after one apply_deferred_stop). Depth/Color/Sidecar/State model the
\* depth discard, color DeleteFileW, sidecar writes and state store. Cancel
\* (stop(true) or capture's apply_deferred_stop) may land at any step until done;
\* one after Decide is too late and the take completes. Process termination and
\* errors raised by other threads after the barrier are not modeled.
