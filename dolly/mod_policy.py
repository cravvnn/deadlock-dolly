"""Decide which installed mod mounts may join a Dolly editing session.

Content mods (skins, models, maps, audio) are carried into the temporary
session file; render, visual-interface and startup-config overrides are not.
Those change what the camera capture sees, or fight Dolly's own HUD hiding and
UI override, which is exactly why the isolated editing session exists.

The decision is made from the mount's own content, never from a mod name:
loose files and the directory trees of VPK packs are inspected without reading
payloads. Unreadable or linked content is refused rather than guessed at;
non-asset replay storage is ignored without traversing it.
